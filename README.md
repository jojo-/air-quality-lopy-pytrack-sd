# air-quality-lopy-pytrack-sd
Air quality sensor for bushfires. The sensor saves the data on a SD card.

The sensor is monitoring PM 1, 2.5 and 10. It is based on
- a SEN0177 PM sensor;
- a LoPy for processing the data from the PM sensor;
- a PyTrack expansion board to sync the RTC of the LoPy using GPS and to write the data on an SD card.
